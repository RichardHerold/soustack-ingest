TERRY BOWMAN’S ARMADILLO DIP
By: 
Terry Bowman
Ingredients: 
1 Ground Chuck
1 Package Taco Seasoning
1 Jar Hot Picante Sauce
1 Jar Hot Cheese Whiz

Preparation:

Step 1:
Brown ground chuck and then pour off the grease. This is purely a consideration for the consistency of the dip and should in no way be construed as a fat saving measure.

Step 2:
Dump in a bunch of the taco seasoning, hot picante sauce and hot cheese whiz. It’s sort of like a fancy ro-tel dip, only hotter and more fattening, on account of the beef.

Step 3:
This stuff is great on Fritos and or scoopable Tostito’s, as long as they are not the low fat baked variety. We are against those. This combo is so hot and so salty that you will quickly need lots of Margaritas.

PIES

MARY BOWMAN - PIES AND PASTRY

SINGLE
2/3 cup plus 2 tbsp. shortening or 2/3 cup lard
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. salt
4 to 5 tbsp. cold water
DOUBLE
1 1/3 + 4 tbsp. shortening
4 cups flour
2 tsp. salt
8 to 10 tbsp. cold water


TRIPLE
2 cups plus 6 tbsp. shortening
6 cups flour
3 tsp. salt
12 to 15 tbsp. cold water
8 or 9 inch two-crust pie

Cut shortening into flour and salt until particles are size of small peas.  Sprinkle in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons water can be added if necessary).

Gather pastry into a ball; shape into flattened round on lightly floured cloth-covered board.  (For two-crust pie, divide pastry into halves and shape into 2 rounds).  Roll pastry 2 inches larger than inverted pie plate with floured stockinet-covered rolling pin.  Fold pastry into quarters; unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.

For baked pie shell: prick bottom and side thoroughly with fork.  Bake at 475 until light brown, 8 to 10 minutes; cool.

For two-crust pie: turn desired filling into pastry-lined pie plate.  Trim overhanging edge of pastry ½ inch from rim of plate.  Roll other round of pastry. Fold into quarters; cut slits so steam can escape.  Place over filling and unfold.  Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1 inch from rim of plate.  Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute cover edge with 2 to 3 inch strip of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning; remove foil during last 15 minutes of baking.  Bake as directed in recipe.

Note:  if possible, hook fluted edge over edge of pie plate to prevent shrinking and help pastry retain its shape.

Whole wheat pastry: prepare filling before preparing pastry.  Substitute whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour or substitute stone-ground whole wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour.  Fold rolled pastry in half instead of into quarters.VANILLA CREAM PIE

NANA WOLFF’S SPECIALTY

1 package saltine crackers
1 jar of jelly

Go to the pantry and open the drawer (you know which one)
Take out the crackers and bring them to nana.  
Open the refrigerator and take out the jelly – bring it to nana.

Have nana spread the jelly on the saltines for you – they taste better that way (cuz she spreads then with love as well as jelly).  If you’re good, she might make you a cup of coffee with lots of milk to go with them.  Then sit at the counter and chat with the best grandmother that ever lived!

IT DOESN’T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT!

FRIED EGGS

Heat margarine, butter or bacon fat in heavy skillet to 1/8-inch depth just until hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.  Break each egg into custard cup or saucer; carefully slip 1 egg at a time into skillet.  Immediately reduce heat to low.

Cook, spooning margarine onto eggs, until whites are set and a film forms over yolks (sunny-side up).  Or gently turn eggs over when whites are set and cook until desired doneness.
