  "ingredients": [
    "1 pkg. active dry yeast",
    "1 tbsp. sugar"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "½ cup warm water (110-115 degrees approx.)",
    "2 ½ cups flour",
    "2 tsp. salt",
    "7/8 cups warm milk",
    "¼ tsp. baking soda dissolved in 1 tbsp warm water",
    "Combine yeast, sugar, and warm water in a large bowl; stir until the yeast and sugar are dissolved, and let the mixture sit until it starts to foam.",
    "Add the flour, mixed with the salt, and the warm milk in alternate portions while stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon.",
    "Holding the bowl tightly, beat the dough very hard until it shows some elasticity and looks almost ready to leave the bowl (unlike kneaded dough, it will remain loose and sticky). When it has a gummy quality, cover and let rise in a warm place for about an hour – hour and a half, until doubled in bulk.",
    "Stir down with a wooden spoon, add the dissolved soda, and beat vigorously again for about 1 minute, being careful to distribute the soda thoroughly, or else the bread will be streaked.",
    "Butter a 9x5 inch pan and fill with the dough, using a rubber spatula to scrape it from the bowl. Cover lightly with a plastic wrap.",
    "Let it rise again in a warm place for about 1-1 ¼ hours.",
    "Bake the bread in a preheated 375 degree oven until it’s golden on top and slightly shrinks from the sides of the pan.",
    "Cool in pans for about 5 minutes, and then turn onto a rack."
