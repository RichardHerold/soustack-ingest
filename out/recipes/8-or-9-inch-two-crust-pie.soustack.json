    "Cut shortening into flour and salt until particles are size of small peas.  Sprinkle in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons water can be added if necessary).",
    "Gather pastry into a ball; shape into flattened round on lightly floured cloth-covered board.  (For two-crust pie, divide pastry into halves and shape into 2 rounds).  Roll pastry 2 inches larger than inverted pie plate with floured stockinet-covered rolling pin.  Fold pastry into quarters; unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.",
    "For baked pie shell: prick bottom and side thoroughly with fork.  Bake at 475 until light brown, 8 to 10 minutes; cool.",
    "For two-crust pie: turn desired filling into pastry-lined pie plate.  Trim overhanging edge of pastry ½ inch from rim of plate.  Roll other round of pastry. Fold into quarters; cut slits so steam can escape.  Place over filling and unfold.  Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1 inch from rim of plate.  Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute cover edge with 2 to 3 inch strip of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning; remove foil during last 15 minutes of baking.  Bake as directed in recipe.",
    "Note:  if possible, hook fluted edge over edge of pie plate to prevent shrinking and help pastry retain its shape.",
    "Whole wheat pastry: prepare filling before preparing pastry.  Substitute whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour or substitute stone-ground whole wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour.  Fold rolled pastry in half instead of into quarters.\fVANILLA CREAM PIE"
